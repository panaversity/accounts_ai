# Accounts AI

## 📄 Requirement Specification Document

**Product Name:** Accounts AI
**Vision:** To build an AI-native accounting platform that augments existing systems (QuickBooks, Xero, Odoo, Dynamics, etc.) and gradually evolves into a standalone, AI-powered financial operating system for SMEs and enterprises.

---

## 1. **Overview**

Accounts AI is an **AI-based accounting co-pilot** that integrates with existing accounting systems to automate bookkeeping, compliance, insights, and decision support.
Using a **hybrid approach**, the platform will first augment existing systems via plugins and connectors, then transition into a fully autonomous AI-native accounting engine and platform.

---

## 2. **Objectives**

* Automate repetitive accounting tasks (data entry, categorization, reconciliation).
* Provide proactive insights (cash flow forecasts, anomaly detection, compliance alerts).
* Support multiple accounting systems via connectors.
* Transition from augmentation → standalone system → full financial platform.
* Deliver trust, security, and compliance for global adoption.

---

## 3. **Target Market**

* **SMEs (small & medium enterprises):** Fastest adoption via QuickBooks/Xero integrations.
* **Emerging markets (Asia, Africa, Middle East):** Odoo and Zoho integrations.
* **Mid-market/enterprise:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 integration.
* **Future expansion:** SAP/Oracle for large enterprises.

---

## 4. **Phased Roadmap**

### **Phase 1 (0–12 months): AI Co-Pilot Plugins**

* Build integrations with **QuickBooks Online**, **Xero**, and later **Odoo**.
* Deliver AI features:

  * Transaction categorization.
  * Invoice/receipt OCR + auto-booking.
  * Cash flow dashboards.
  * AI chatbot for natural language Q\&A.
* Compliance baseline: Read-only integrations, SOC 2/GDPR-ready.

### **Phase 2 (12–24 months): AI-Native Accounting Engine**

* Develop a core double-entry ledger system.
* Unified Financial Data Model (FDM) for cross-platform abstraction.
* Advanced AI features:

  * Predictive forecasting.
  * Voice-based transaction input.
  * Automated anomaly/fraud detection.
* Migration pipelines (QuickBooks → Accounts AI, Xero → Accounts AI, etc.).

### **Phase 3 (24–48 months): Full AI Platform**

* Autonomous workflows (AI handling invoicing, payments, tax filing).
* Ecosystem expansion (payroll, HR, banking APIs, Web3 support).
* Marketplace model for 3rd-party developers.
* Regional compliance modules (FBR, GST, VAT, IRS).
* Position as the **AI CFO** for SMEs/enterprises.
